# Alloy Problem


## PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
The Metalco Company desires to blend a new alloy of 40% tin, 35% zinc, and 25% lead from several available alloys having the properties given in Table. Formulate a linear program whose solution would yield the proportions of these alloys that should be blended to produce a new alloy at minimum cost.

|             | Alloy1 | Alloy2 | Alloy3 | Alloy4 | Alloy5 |
|:------------|:-------|:-------|:-------|:-------|:-------|
| %Tin        | 60     | 25     | 45     | 20     | 50     |
| %Zinc       | 10     | 15     | 45     | 50     | 40     |
| %Lead       | 30     | 60     | 10     | 30     | 10     |
| Cost($/lb.) | 22     | 20     | 25     | 24     | 27     |
